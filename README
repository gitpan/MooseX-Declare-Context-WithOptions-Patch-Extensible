NAME
    MooseX::Declare::Context::WithOptions::Patch::Extensible - patch
    MooseX::Declare for extensibility

SYNOPSIS
     use MooseX::Declare::Context::WithOptions::Patch::Extensible;

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends MooseX::Declare::Context::WithOptions to add a new
    attribute `allowed_option_names` containing an arrayref of option names
    that it can parse. The default is the standard MooseX::Declare list of
    'extends', 'with' and 'is'.

    It also patches the `strip_options` method so that it pays attention to
    that arrayref.

    If you don't understand why you'd need to do this, then you probably don't
    need to do this.
